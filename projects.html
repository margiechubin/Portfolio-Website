				<h3>This website</h3>
				<p>
					This is my online portfolio, which started as an assignment in ENG 100. Throughout this project I learned basic web development by coding in HTML/CSS, utilized source control for the project with Github, and managed my website hosting through FTP. By revising it about two years later, I am adding more knowledge and experience to the project.

					For my team's project, <a href="http://restaurandom.me/">Restaurandom</a>, we wanted to ease the difficulty for chronically indecisive folks of choosing where to eat. Using an API, we give the user information such as the cuisine or price level of great restaurants near a given location. One may enter a zip code or city, and get a "restaurandomized" suggestion based on popularity.

				<h3>Fundraising Account Checker</h3>
				<p>
					In high school, I was on the Dance Marathon exec board. Sensing a lack of communication between the Executive Board and the fundraising students, I designed an <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/dm219.org/dmfinance/">online application</a> using Google's API that accesses the fundraising data from private google sheets. Rather than ask someone to look up information, the information is available through the application. It has been used for a few years now and has over 3000 views.

				<h3>Fruit Frenzy Game</h3>
				<p class="col-md-8">
					<br> I have also written a few games, one can be seen
					 <a href="http://www.vikingcomputerscience.com/mobile/VG/Game02/index.html#!">here</a>. I wrote this simple game as a free choice project in my video game programming class in high school. We had a few weeks to implement any game we wanted, with a mobile focus in mind. Written in C#, it was meant to be my version of another game I had found online. While it can be played by clicking the fruit quickly on a computer, the real fun comes with the touch screen mobile phone version, where the higher levels can be reached.
